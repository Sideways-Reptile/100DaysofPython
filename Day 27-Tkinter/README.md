# Notes from the Day
Position Managers for Tk

-pack() Uses things like left, right, top bottom for placement\
-place() Can place items specifically, however, it can be hard to now exactly where to place. Uses x, y coordinates\
-grid() Can be used like Place but uses column, row

CANNOT USE grid AND pack in the same file.
These are used to place the tkinter widgets
