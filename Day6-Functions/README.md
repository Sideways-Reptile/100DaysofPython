**Day 6 Notes**

**FUNCTIONS**
Today I learned about Functions; how to use them, write them, 
call them, etc. Today's lesson was mostly demonstrated on Reeborg.ca 
and the coding was done in building block kind of way. Good enough to 
understand the topics and what was happening. No files to save for this
project day.
