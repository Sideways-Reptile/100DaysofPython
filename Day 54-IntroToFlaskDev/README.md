# Notes

Decorators are functions that allow use to make better use
of other functions in our code. This way, if we want to make
some changes to how a function is called and therefore runs,
a decorator can be used. Essentially, we can pass other functions
in as aspects of the decorator. In this code, 
the fast and slow functions are being timed ia code in their 
decorator.
