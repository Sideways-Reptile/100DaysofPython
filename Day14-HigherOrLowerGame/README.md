#NOTES

This program checks the number of followers against two celebrities. The winner stays
and the loser gets changed out. Some things I learned on this one are:
- How to substitute data in variable location. For instance, letting account B
receive a value first, then setting account A to that value then B gets a random
account. this way, we can essentially have account A's value be 'open' so that A and B
can switch.
- Still need to figure out how to get the clear() to work.
