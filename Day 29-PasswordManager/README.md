learning about columnspan in tkinter.

used to allow an item on the canvas to spread across
mutiple columns. Also rowspan.

    x.grid(row=1, column=0, columnspan=2)

this will allow the x item t be placed at column 0 and span across
2 columns (columns 0 and 1)

Learning more about tkinter functionality and how to .get() info from 
an entry field, how to .delete(0, END) the text from a field,
and how to .focus() the cursor to a particular entry. Also how to .insert()
text from other variable

Also began learning about message/dialog boxes to inform a 
user of a successful process completion. 

This was a pretty fun project. Pulled my code from Day 5 Password Generator
and updated it to reflect some new things I learned like list comprehension
to clean up the code and get things done in a more Pythonic way.
