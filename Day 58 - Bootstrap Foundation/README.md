# Bootstrap
---
This is a Front-End development tool that acts as a CSS framework that can allow us to more easily edit CCS-like aspects
of a website without having to write such extensive CSS files. Easy to implement; add a href link to the CDN site to include
Bootstrap. 

This is not the same as Flask - Flask is Back-End, Bootstrap is Front-End. They work together to provide a complete
website/application. 


## WireFraming
design the website w/ Pencil and Paper before writing code; Low-Fi. This is meant to provide a workflow/desire for the website
before getting into working on the site. A Mock-Up is basically a High-Fi workup of what the site WILL look like
when complete.
